# Everything you need to get others interested

## Definitions
- hax - headless authoring experience. A platform built on web components
- web components - an HTML browser meta specification envisioned in 2011, gaining full browser adoption in 2018, market / user acceptance in 2021
 - JS modules - `<script type="module">` means that JS can sustainably reference other js files
 - custom elements - meaning we can define our own valid HTML tags and define them
 - `<template>` - an HTML tag that says "hold valid HTML but don't actually stamp / render it until told"
 - shadowDom - meaning CSS / functionality is scoped to the component.

## Why this spec is so powerful
- make new html tags out of old ones... or new ones and stack new ones in newer ones
- single what-ever.js file is a `<what-ever>` tag
- low level browser spec means they are highly performant
- Any library that inherits from this spec works together naturally
- Our team has made over 924 open source web components that can stack infinitely

## Why this will kill wordpress in edu (long term, in many instances, focusing on pedagogy atm)
- faster to build a site
- static by default
- portable - download as zip
- forever - HTML, built using web standards, load the JS and you load the semantic tags
- Built with microservices in mind - advanced functionality shipped off to individual microservices on vercel. backend does minimal it has to to save in right location, know who you are (JWT) and rebuild the static files
- hax (editor only) integrations - drupal 6,7,8,9 / wordpress / gravcms / anywhere `h-a-x` can be loaded and wrapped
- new bricks are always HTML spec web component that works anywhere 1st, then inform HAX about how to edit it(bricks can be engineered to help improve UX in HAX if that's required though)
- working on import from pressbooks... which is wordpress.
- working on screen scrapers to convert common WP / Drupal themes into haxcms sites

## Public examples of things built
- https://oer.courses.science.psu.edu/ every site on this page (and the page itself)

- We have ~50 more courses beyond these but are PSU auth'ed

- https://openpublishing.psu.edu/digital-beaumont-fletcher-about-project  EDITIONS section (running HAX + 11ty)
- hax.psu.edu - PaaS instance (HAXiam) for any PSU member

## What we need
- people to bang on it, bump against it, and ask probing questions, more eyes on it and challenging it
- docs / marketing / style guide - putting students on this
- collaborators
- grants, media, published articles,
- external momentum

## What we have
- three colleges contributing + university library leveraging this currently (40 more site rolls outs by library slated over the next 2 years).
- 0 internal marketting (starting late July) and yet, 1500+ of accounts (yet I've only had about 300 students)
- A pipeline where I train ~54 developers a semester in the tech stack that powers HAX and their final projects solve a different need we have in our project
 - Top solutions adopted (last semester solutions: https://github.com/elmsln/issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A7B+ )
 - Top contributors tapped to do more involving independent studies in teams
- A team of instructional designers, ID assistants, faculty, multimedia, accessibility experts, site builders, students, developers and 1 engineer with an activist mindset.
- Weekly processing / intake of issues from users
- Monthly core team user group to review possible solutions / problems
- bi-monthly faculty advisory council that is shown solutions and gets feedback prior to roll out

## core tenants
- small / fast - everyone deserves the web, device, country and paycheck agnostic
- 100% open source, always
- make web publishing like water. fluid, as easy as turning on a faucet to community plumbing
- composable - break off an icon, or the editor, or a menu, or the CMS, everything works everywhere
- remixable - able to break things apart into smallest atoms and remix and share anywhere. pull in any (legacy) format, output any format
- everyone means everyone - minimal UI "clicks" to do anything. Everyone's creativity need not be blocked by tech
- accessible without thinking about it - automate a11y as much as possible, UDL informing every aspect of system design
- building up from the HAX instructional design ontology -- https://app.mural.co/t/haxontologybrainstorming9982/m/haxontologybrainstorming9982/1681756048455/510134d2a848ecdd11975713d888fa363310401e?sender=a9c8a942-a8e4-4b74-a2a2-7ac07deb4385
